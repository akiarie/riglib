# Some Latin Texts Analysed and Compared with riglib.

# Terms.
The **riglib score (RS)** is defined as the unique word-count of the riglib output of a document,
and the **riglib overlap (RO)** of two documents is the word-count of the intersection of their
outputs. For more on this, see the [readme](README.md).

# Establishing benchmarks.
The RS and RO (given two texts) figures are difficult to apply directly to the learning process, so
several benchmark-texts shall be selected. 

As a specimen of the words that intermediate learners might know, I have selected the 
[world list](https://www.hackettpublishing.com/pdfs/Familia_Romana_Latin-English_Vocabulary.pdf)
from _Familia Romana_ of _Lingua Latina pe se Illustrata_
and also the [DCC Latin core vocabulary](https://dcc.dickinson.edu/latin-core-list1) list.
