# riglib.
_A tool for analysing words in a text to assess the difficulty of (Latin) books._

# Overview.

_riglib_ is short for _rigor librī_, and therefore functions as a tool for assessing the difficulty
of a Latin work, to facilitate the learner in charting out a route of works to read in sequence.

It works by feeding in each input line into 
[Whitaker's words](http://archives.nd.edu/whitaker/words.htm)
and selecting all the word-forms in the inflection lines it outputs. 

To get an idea of the kind of analysis that it can produce, see [this document](ANALYSES.md).

# Preparing input for riglib.

riglib accepts as its input a list of words, such as can be produced with a command like
```bash
$ cat [TEXT FILE] | tr ' ' '\n' | tr -cd '[:alpha:]\n' | sort | uniq > word-list.txt
```
where `[TEXT FILE]` is the path to a book.

_Note_. The input book must not contain vowel signs such as _ā_, _ē_, _ī_, _ō_, _ū_. To strip these
add
```bash
$ iconv -f utf8 -t ascii//TRANSLIT
```
to the pipeline above, prior to the command to strip non-alpha characters.

# Usage.

To use the tool, simply type
```bash
$ riglib [FILE 1] [FILE 2] [FILE 3] # etc.
```
where `[FILE 1]`, `[FILE 2]`, `[FILE 3]`, etc. are the files to be analysed.

## Printing unknown words.

riglib ignores unknown words, thereby elminating anything which Whitaker's words does not consider
to be Latin. This is advantageous when working with large files and there is no time to filter out
non-Latin words, but may be a problem for well-transcribed documents. There is therefore the
optional _print-unknown mode_,
```bash
$ riglib -u [FILE]
```
or
```bash
$ riglib --print-unknown [FILE]
```
for situations where one desires to retain all the input words.

## Interpreting riglib's output.

For the sake of efficiency, riglib does not bother to sort its output, nor does it avoid repeat
outputs. Thus to obtain a word-count one will regularly use
```bash
$ riglib [FILE] | sort | uniq | wc -l
```
or something of the like.

This figure, which we may name the **riglib score (RS)**, gives one a very accurate estimate
regarding the number of Latin forms or word-families that the inputted work contains.

## Comparing two texts.

To compare the difficulty of two texts, first pass them through riglib and store their outputs. Then
run the following (where `[OUTPUT 1]` and `[OUTPUT 2]` as the paths to the two riglib outputs)
```bash
$ sort [OUTPUT 1] [OUTPUT 2] | uniq -d | wc -l
```
to get a count of the intersection set of forms, the **riglib overlap (RO)**.


## Obtaining known-word density.

The **known-word density (KWD)** is perhaps more important than the RO for assessing how difficult
moving from an accessbile text to another one. It is obtained by typing
```bash
$ riglib -c [DICT FILE] [WORD LIST]
```
or
```bash
$ riglib --word-coverage [DICT FILE] [WORD LIST]
```
where `[DICT FILE]` is the sorted, unique output of riglib operating on the understood wordlist, and
`[WORD LIST]` is produced with
```bash
$ cat [BOOK FILE] | tr ' ' '\n' | tr -cd '[:alpha:]\n' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sort > [WORD LIST]
```
with `[BOOK FILE]` being the work under consideration.

The output will be something like
```bash
Included: 5904, Total: 6307, Coverage: 0.94, Unknown: 58, Known coverage: 0.94 # exemplary figures
```
- _Included_: The number of word-forms found in `[BOOK FILE]` that are in `[DICT FILE]`
- _Total_: The total words in `[BOOK FILE]`
- _Coverage_: The ratio _Included_ / _Total_
- _Unknown_: The number of word-forms found in `[BOOK FILE]` that Whitaker's words couldn't identify
- _Known coverage_: The ratio _Included_ / (_Total_ – _Unknown_), the **KWD**.
